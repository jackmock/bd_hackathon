# bd_hackathon

# Repo for my entry into the July 2025 BOOT.DEV Hackathon event, which runs 9:00:00 AM MDT on 07/25/2025 to 9:00:00 AM MDT on 07/28/2025. 


# PLANNING

# There are a few things I'd like to accomplish during the event's timeframe-

# --HTML site to show off projects:
o also have a site of my own to host some projects, particularly any that can run in-browser. I've always found it neat to come acros
# I'd like to get a simple HTML site up and running. I do use GH, but I think it'd be cool ts someone's (fairly simple) html site with things they've worked on, and I think it'd be cool to have my own.



# --The first project to put onto the site:

# I've had a few ideas of things to code up and have online, but given a number of limiting factors (working solo, limited experience, being cautious about scope-creep), I think it'd be wise to keep it simple. I may end up doing something as simple as coding up a simple calculator app- point being, I probably won't be doing anything groundbreaking. If I end up having additional time, maybe I can put a few micro-projects together or add features.

# I haven't nailed down exactly what I'm coding up as of me writing this README up initially, but once I get the site working, I'll start putting something together.


# Ultimately, my main goal here is to lay the groundwork for future projects and gain some experience managing scope on a deadline.

# Thanks for checking my stuff out :D
